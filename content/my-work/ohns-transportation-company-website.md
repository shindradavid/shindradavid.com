This project centered on establishing the digital credibility and marketing presence for OHN'S TRANSPORTATION, a new initiative designed to unify and professionalize urban transport in Kampala, Uganda.

I developed a dedicated, high-impact marketing website with the strategic purpose of:

- Boosting Credibility: Clearly articulating OHN'S commitment to passenger security, rigorous driver training, and local empowerment, thereby differentiating them from fragmented local services.

- Promoting the Mobile App: Serving as the central hub for showcasing the features of the new Uber-like OHN'S APP and directing users to download it.

The website's narrative focuses purely on the company's vision and value proposition—a unified, reliable, and technology-driven service—setting the stage for the mobile application to successfully enter the market.
