I designed and developed a compelling digital storefront for Westnile Distilling Company Limited (Adrikos), transforming their 40-year history and mission into an engaging online presence.

The core goal was to establish Adrikos as the preferred regional spirit brand by highlighting their commitment to organic materials and high-quality production. The design, fully wireframed in Figma, features rich visuals of their product line (gins, vodkas, and more) and uses a clear narrative structure to convey their vision for Ugandan economic growth. The resulting responsive, performance-optimized website serves as a vital marketing tool, reinforcing brand identity and providing crucial information about their diverse product range to the global market.
